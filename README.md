# Booking_Calendar
A front end for a Covid Test booking calendar for Royal Borough of Greenwich Council

## A Javascript Front End 

The app uses a Javascript Front End Interface for a booking system that allow users to book Covid-19 tests at a local surgery. 
The frontend uses Javascript to reserve a time slot and sends it to a PHP and SQL backend booking system that reserves a 30 min slot at 1 of several locations in the borough.
